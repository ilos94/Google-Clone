# Have access to the code and the project

To try the code and use or just to have access to my project you need : 

- Download the repository 

- Make sure that they all are in the same folder

You can try it on Codepen or modify it,but you need to take the assets from this repertory because the site doesn't give the option to upload  an asset without paid :

# What can you add

On this project, there is no search function all of this project is front work, we didn't used java or linked a button to a logger or things like this , you can always do it by yourself , you just need to take the repositories "Google Clone" make a folder with the same files and modify them on visual studio code or add images to it by yourself.

For this project I was with two others comrades 

Andrew (not working on code anymore)

Olivier (not working on code anymore)

Mohamed (I)

but they are not working in code anymore , but they were still really useful for this project.


Project made by using HTML5,CSS3
